# Story 9.0: Cleanup Auth for V0

**Status:** Draft

## Story

**As a** product owner,
**I want** to remove Google and Apple login options from the login screen,
**so that** users only log in via email for the V0 release, as social providers are not configured on Supabase.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  Google login button is removed from `LoginScreen`.
2.  Apple login button is removed from `LoginScreen`.
3.  "Or continue with" divider text is removed if it becomes redundant.
4.  Email login flow remains fully functional.
5.  Layout adjusts gracefully to the removal of these buttons.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] UI: Remove Social Login Buttons from `LoginScreen` <!-- id: 1 -->
- [ ] UI: Clean up "Or continue with" divider <!-- id: 2 -->
- [ ] Verification: Test Email Login <!-- id: 3 -->

## Dev Notes

- File: `apps/mobile/lib/features/auth/screens/login_screen.dart`
- Currently uses `SocialLoginButton` widgets or similar.
