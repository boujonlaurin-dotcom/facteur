# Story 4.1e: Score Transparency Breakdown

> **Parent Story**: [[../core/4.1.feed-algorithme.md]]  
> **Type**: Evolution

**As a** user curious or skeptical about algorithms,  
**I want** to see the detailed breakdown of why an article was recommended to me,  
**so that** I can trust the platform and understand how my preferences influence my feed.

## Status: ✅ Completed (21/01/2026)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. [x] **Backend Schema**: Update `RecommendationReason` to include a list of `ScoreContribution`.
2. [x] **API Hydration**: Populate the breakdown with French human-readable labels and exact points.
3. [x] **Mobile Model**: Update Dart models to support the new JSON structure.
4. [x] **UI Trigger**: Add an info icon (ℹ) in the `FeedCard` recommendation tag.
5. [x] **UI Display**: Show a Modal Bottom Sheet with the total score and list of contributors (Theme, Source, Topics, etc.).

## Technical Implementation

- **API**: Modified `recommendation_service.py` to synthesize reasons into `ScoreContribution` objects.
- **Frontend**: Modified `feed_card.dart` to include `_showScoreBreakdown()`.

## Verification

- **Script**: `packages/api/scripts/verify_score_breakdown.py` validates the JSON structure.
- **Manual**: UI verified on iOS Simulator.

## Notes
- Wording validated by PM: "Pourquoi cet article vous est recommandé ?"
- Footer added to explain algorithm defaults.
