# Story 7.5: FQS Granular Scores

## Goal
Connect the "Source Detail" cards in the mobile app to real backend data for the FQS pillars (Independence, Journalist Rigor, UX), replacing hardcoded mock data.

## Context
The Facteur Quality Score (FQS) is a core differentiator. Showing the granular scores increases transparency and trust.

## Requirements
- [x] Backend: Add `score_independence`, `score_rigor`, `score_ux` to `Source` model.
- [x] Backend: Generate and apply DB migration.
- [x] Backend: Update `import_sources.py` to populate scores with heuristic values.
- [ ] Backend: Update `SourceService` to return these scores in `SourceResponse`.
- [x] Frontend: Update `Source` model to parse new fields.
- [x] Frontend: Bind `SourceDetailModal` UI to real data.

## Heuristic Mapping
- **HIGH** -> 0.9, 0.9, 0.8
- **MEDIUM/MIXED** -> 0.6, 0.6, 0.6
- **LOW** -> 0.3, 0.3, 0.4
- **UNKNOWN** -> None
