# Project State: Facteur — Digest Production Fixes (v1.0.1)

**Current Phase:** 1 — Production Fixes  
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-07  
**Status:** ⚪ Milestone initialized — Ready for planning

---

## Current Position

**Milestone:** v1.0.1 — Digest Production Fixes  
**Phase:** 01-production-fixes  
**Plan:** —  
**Next:** Create Phase 1 plans  

**Progress:** Phase 1: 0/3 plans  

```
Phase 1 Production Fixes: [○○○] 0% (0/3)
```

---

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-07)

**Core value:** Digest must regenerate daily at 8am with diverse source representation  
**Current focus:** v1.0.1 — Critical bug fixes  
**Key principle:** Minimal changes, maximum safety

---

## Phase Status

| Phase | Status | Progress | Plans Complete |
|-------|--------|----------|----------------|
| 1 — Production Fixes | ⚪ Not Started | 0% | 0/3 |

---

## Milestone Context

**Previous Milestone (Epic 10):** ✅ COMPLETE
- Phase 1 Foundation: 4/4 plans
- Phase 2 Frontend: 15/15 plans
- Phase 3 Polish: Deferred to v1.1

**This Milestone (v1.0.1):**
- Critical production bug fixes
- 2 bugs identified in hand-off
- Estimated 4-6 hours

---

## Critical Bugs to Fix

### Bug 1: Job Scheduler Missing
**Impact:** Digest not regenerating at 8am  
**Fix:** Add `run_digest_generation` to scheduler.py  
**File:** `packages/api/app/workers/scheduler.py`

### Bug 2: Source Diversity Missing  
**Impact:** 5 articles from same source  
**Fix:** Implement decay factor 0.70 in `_select_with_diversity()`  
**File:** `packages/api/app/services/digest_selector.py`

---

## Pending Work

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Phase 1 Production Fixes** ⚪ NOT STARTED (0/3 plans)
   - 01-01: Add digest generation job to scheduler
   - 01-02: Implement source diversity with decay factor
   - 01-03: Verify fixes (scheduler + diversity tests)

---

## Current Blockers

**None** — Ready to proceed with Phase 1 planning.

---

## Decisions Made

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-02-07 | Decay factor 0.70 | Matches existing feed algorithm for consistency |
| 2026-02-07 | Min 3 sources requirement | Ensures meaningful diversity in 5-article digest |
| 2026-02-07 | 8am Europe/Paris timezone | Matches Top 3 schedule, user expectation |
| 2026-02-07 | Skip Phase 3 (Polish) for v1.0.1 | Production fixes are priority, defer notifications |

---

## Concerns & Risks

| Risk | Mitigation | Status |
|------|------------|--------|
| Regression in digest functionality | Comprehensive verification in 01-03 | To monitor |
| Diversity algorithm too aggressive | Test with "Le Monde only" user case | To verify |
| Scheduler timezone issues | Use Europe/Paris, match existing pattern | Low risk |

---

## Next Action

**Phase 1 Production Fixes — Ready for Planning**

Critical bugs identified:
1. Scheduler missing digest generation job
2. Diversity algorithm not implemented
